* I built the nvidia NIM for rfdiffusion on the Marlowe compute cluster
 * Followed instructions in http://docs.marlowe.stanford.edu/ngc_example/ (following example for using Meta LLAMA model).
 * Installed the NIM for RFdiffusion latest 10-29-2024
 * There was a missing file (5TPN needed to be moved to directory from which apptainer was run)
   * noted that run scripts are in /opt/nim/
 * Launched apptainer from `/projects/m000018/docker/` as  `bash /users/btrippe/projects/motif_scaffolding_benchmark/RFDiffusion_baseline/apptainer_run_script.sh`
 * This started up a server on port 8000

* For simplicity, since the NVIDIA NIM does not provide an interface for setting the sequence, this was not incorported at generation time.
TODO: write script to thread on sequence at all but positions to be redesigned...

# So that the NIM could be modified, I copied the run files is /opt/nim to my home directory to modify them, and then in the run script bound this path as
  --bind "~/apptainer_nim_copy:/opt/nim"

# I ran RFdiffusion using the contigs in "motif_scaffolding_benchmark/RFDiffusion_baseline/motif_specs_with_contigs_for_motif_files.csv"
 * Precise run scripts for all problems are in "motif_scaffolding_benchmark/RFDiffusion_baseline/scripts/run_scripts/"
 * These were generated programmatically with "/users/btrippe/projects/motif_scaffolding_benchmark/RFDiffusion_baseline/scripts/write_scripts_by_case.sh" and run on a 8xH100 node on Marlowe using "/motif_scaffolding_benchmark/RFDiffusion_baseline/scripts/run_scripts/launch_all.sh"
 * All jobs completed within 6 hours (approximately 50 GPU-hours)

# To prepare for running evaluation using the Scaffold-lab repository I created motif_info.csv files for each problem using `scripts/write_all_scaffold_lab_motif_info_csvs.sh`
